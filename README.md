Prerequisite (NPM, Nodejs and chrome is installed)

Pull the code from gitlabs (git clone https://github.com/avinashs15/gitHub)

Install NodeJS and NPM

Navigate to the folder where the project is 

Run command (npm install package.json ) => Installs the required packages like protractor, protractor-beautiful-reporter, appendjson since I'm using these packages

If this does not work, install the following packages individually

npm install appendjson

npm install protractor-beautiful-reporter

npm install protractor

Run the protractor using command (protractor config.js)

Navigate to Execution Results folder and open the gitHub.html

**Note : Functional Automation design using Protractor.docx document has explaination about Protractor framework
